People spend a third of their time sleeping, but few of them pay enough attention to their sleep. This year I found myself deficult in falling asleep, so I started to read some books about sleep. Here are some experience I learned from books that are helpful to me.

## Attitude twards Sleeping

1. **Nothing is extremely important**: nothing is extremely important including  a concept, a judgement, an experience. So if you can't sleep well now, it is not extremely important for you. Just take it easy.
2. **Don't share your insomnia experience**: if you regard insomnia as a big problem and keep thinking about it, it will trouble you.
3. **Deal with insomnia with praticing attitude**: there are no pressure to sleep or not not to sleep. When I cant't fall asleep, I think of it as a chance to practice.
4. **Insomnia is the result not cause**: insomnia is the result of anxiety, overuse of electronics etc.  If our thoughts never stop, it will be hard for us to fall asleep.

## Some Ways to Have a Good Sleep

1. **Reduce stimulation**:Sympathetic overstimulation is the biggest cause of our physical and mental imbalance in the 21st century. So stop reading feed news before sleep.
2. **Breth with your nose and breath deeply**: breathing is one of a few exercises that can be carried out contiously and uncontiously. You can try to breath contiously.
3. **keeping tongue in touch with palate**: that will make you breath with your nose.
4. **Yawn**: yawning can relax our nervous. We can even yawn voluntarily.

## Some theories

1. About Sympathetic and Parasympathetic 
  a. **Sympathetic nervous system**: The sympathetic nervous system is also known as the "stress response system". When we encounter an emergency, we first let go of less urgent physiological functions, such as digestion, and deal with stress wholeheartedly. As mentioned earlier, cortisol is a stress hormone, which helps expand the response to stress at the endocrine level.  
  b. **Parasympathetic nervous system**: the role of parasympathetic nervous system is just the opposite, just like in the gap after a crisis, helping the body relax and prepare for recuperation is also indispensable for survival.
2. About Coffee
  a. The half-life period of coffee is 5 hours, which means if you drink a cup of coffee in 12:00 am, it remains a half a cup of coffee in your body in 5:00 pm.  
  b. What coffee can help us is suppressing our netural response to fatigue.

### 睡眠心态的转变

1. 😄 没有一句话、一件事、一个观念、一个理念、一个结论、一个判断……有绝对的重要性。所以失眠又怎样？
2. 🙅 不要分享自己睡不好。当我们把一件事情当作问题，不断去想它，它自然变成一个问题。
3. 🤔 使用练习的心态应对失眠。睡或不睡也就没有压力。甚至，没有睡着的这一刻还值得我们欢喜，因为终于有机会练习。
4. 🥱 失眠是「果」不是「因」，更不是「病」。工作和升学的压力与焦虑，以及现代人长时间使用手机等电子产品，让五官和念头几乎都没有停过。睡眠，本来是身体的本能。然而，对现代人而言，要想睡得好，反而成了一个需要努力去达成的功课。
5. 💤 睡眠，其实可以是我们最好的意识转变工具。很多事情和睡眠一样，并没有那么重要，不需要过分在意。

### 改善睡眠的一些做法

1. 🔈︎ 减少信息对大脑的刺激。交感的过度刺激是我们21世纪最大的身心失衡的原因。
2. 👃 用鼻孔呼吸。把呼吸拉长。呼吸是少有几个可以无意识进行也可以有意识进行的运动。
3. 😜 舌抵上颚，会很自然地用鼻子呼吸，身体放松
4. 🥱 打哈欠可以放松神经、消除疲劳。我们甚至可以主动地打哈欠。
5. 🖥 睡前少看屏幕。屏幕产生的蓝光，降低褪黑激素分泌的效果相当直接。

### 一些理论

1. 🧠 关于交感与副交感
  a. 交感神经系统又被称为“压力反应系统”，让我们在遇到紧急状况时，先放掉不那么急迫的生理功能，例如消化，而全心全意地应付压力。前面谈过皮质醇是压力荷尔蒙，也就是在内分泌的层面帮助扩大压力的反应。    
  b. 副交感神经系统的作用是刚好相反，就像是在危机过后的空档，帮助身体放松下来，准备休养生息，也是生存所不可或缺。  
2. ☕️ 咖啡的半衰期时5小时；🚬尼古丁的半衰期时2小时。  
3. ☕️ 咖啡带来的清醒，其实是去压制身体面对疲劳的自然反应。压制腺苷的受体。
