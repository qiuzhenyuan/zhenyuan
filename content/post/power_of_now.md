**The Only Thing we have is Now**  
Doing well in pressent means doing well in everything. The worst thing is living in the past with regrets and annoyance ,or living in the future with pressure and anxiety.  Even when the future is coming, it will come in the form of pressent.  

**Free Yourself from Your Mind**  
Your mind is a tool for thinking, which is used for specific task. When finishing the task, it can pause and have a rest. It is good for you to make some space for yourself and free yourself from your mind. Because if you can't control your mind, you can't live in pressent. Asking yourself a question: can you press the PAUSE button of yourself to stopping thinking in any time?  

**When You Feel Pain**  
When you feel pain, you can ask yourself some questions, "What is happening?", "How do I feel?", "Why do I have theses feelings?", "How do I labeled these feelings as pain?"...  
Our mind tends to deny the pressent and escape from pressent. So the more you agree with your mind, the more you feel pain. In other words, the more you live in pressent, the less you feel pain.

**Pressent is not the Stepping Stone of Future**  
Putting too much weight on goal will make the pressent lose value, which becoming the necessary step to achieve your goal. But the more you focus on future, the more you lose pressent, which is the most important thing of all.   
Freeing yourself from time means stopping looking for identification from past and stopping looking for satisfaction from future.

**What We Should Avoid**  
When your mind is filled by hundred of things, which are need to be done in the future, you will not able to focus in the pressent. When you mind is full of questions, the solution won't come.

## Chinese Version(中文版)

**我们唯一拥有的就是当下**   
搞定当下就是搞定一切。未来即使来临，也是以当下的形式来临。最怕就是心在过去，满怀悔恨和懊恼，或是心在未来，满怀压力和焦虑。

**从思维中解放出来**  
大脑是一个思维的工具，是用来处理特殊任务的，当思维任务完成时，它就可以停下来了。给自己创造一些空白，从思维中解放出来。当你控制不住自己的思维，你就无法进入当下。你能随时随地按下暂停键，停止思维吗？

**痛苦时，问自己这些问题**  
遇到痛苦时问问自己，当下正在发生什么？我的感受如何？我时如何给自己的感受贴上痛苦的标签的。思维通常否认当下，并试图逃离当下。换句话说，你越是认同自己的思维，你就越感到痛苦。或者可以这样说：你越是接受当下，你受的苦就越少。

**当下不是未来的踏脚石**   
过分关注未来的目标，会让当下失去价值，沦为未来的踏脚石，成为达到目标的强迫性需要。你越关注时间—过去和未来，你就会越多地错过当下。当下才是最为珍贵的东西。从时间中解脱就是：从你在过去中寻找认同感的心理需要以及在未来寻找满足的心理需要中解放出来。

**什么是坏的状态**   
“你大脑中背负着100件你在未来将会或必须做的事情的重担，却没有将注意力集中在一件你现在就能做的事情上。” 当你脑子里充满问题时，新的事物或问题的解决方案就无法进入你的大脑。
