People spend a third of their time sleeping, but few of them pay enough attention to their sleep. This year I found myself deficult in falling asleep, so I started to read some books about sleep. Here are some experience I learned from books that are helpful to me.

## Attitude twards Sleeping

1. **Nothing is extremely important**: nothing is extremely important including  a concept, a judgement, an experience. So if you can't sleep well now, it is not extremely important for you. Just take it easy.
2. **Don't share your insomnia experience**: if you regard insomnia as a big problem and keep thinking about it, it will trouble you.
3. **Deal with insomnia with praticing attitude**: there are no pressure to sleep or not not to sleep. When I cant't fall asleep, I think of it as a chance to practice.
4. **Insomnia is the result not cause**: insomnia is the result of anxiety, overuse of electronics etc.  If our thoughts never stop, it will be hard for us to fall asleep.
